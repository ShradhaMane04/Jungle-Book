    <h2>A powerful Bengal tiger, Shere Khan is considered suave and charming, yet is deeply feared as the most ferocious predator in the jungle. His reputation was such that he needed only to show himself to intimidate his victims. Khan is equally notorious for his animosity toward man, due to his fear of guns and fire. As such, he has vowed to kill any human that steps foot in the jungle.</h2>
